Sessions:

1572 rows are found to have duplicated ssid (1.56% of total), which are removed before further processes. Although "gr" and "st" are different in these rows, the first_value is kept to avoid taking acount of the same transaction in different groups of gr.

After analyze:

28778 transactions, 4263 conversions are reported after joining the 3 tables. Those values are slight smaller than the info got from order table, because some orders are not recorded in session table. 

Notice: the two resulted dataFrame are stored into local mySQL server and "tsv" folder as well.

Further analysis can include visualizations of the results based on the mysql queries. For example: 

Analyze the number of conversions, total revenue, number of sessions, conversions/sessions vs. starting time, source, ad, siteId, browser... 20 relationships
